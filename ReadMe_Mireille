--- Reflection Observational Tool Excercises ---

* Measuring Tape *
Performative qualities:
- Black button on the side can be shoved up an down to make the measuring tape fixed or loose. It functions as a lock.
- Measure tape can measure objects or people up to 5 metres
- A thing on the side can let the measuring tape stick to a platform that's less thick then 0,5 cm
- Small wristband limits the use of the measuring tape, but can make sure that the measuring tape will not fall
Affordances:
- Throw it
- Crush it
- Move small and or light things with it
- You can scare people with it
- You can steal things with it
- You can kick it
- Tie someone down
- Swallow it
Noticeable:
- It is rather flexible when the measuring tape is exposed, but ones it rolls back into the red object it becomes stiff and unmovable
- When using the wristband, you are limited in the use of it
- The measure tape can support itself pretty well. Around 1.5 metre it breaks.


* Gameboy *
Instruction for humans:
1. Open the Gameboy with preferably your hands, but if you want a challenge then open it with another body part. 
2. On the right side you see a switch. Turn it upwards to turn the Gameboy on.
3. Take a certain position in the environment  Do not play in the sun, because you won’t be seeing a thing, due to the reflection of possible sun.
4. Think about the game you want to play  Think about what mood you are in, think about how much time you have and think about the work you still have to do.
5. Play the game that you chose
6. Tap buttons with your fingers, or whatever you like.
7. Try to understand the game  also try to keep relaxed (you do not affect society, you are doing this for fun).
8. Play this game until you are tired of it.

After Step 8, you have two options:
1. You put your Gameboy away
2. You choose another game to play  repeat this until you are tired of it, the battery is down or you start to do something productive again.

Affordances of the Gameboy:
1.	Use it as a mirror
2.	Create a beat
3.	Interfere with someone else who plays the Gameboy
4.	Use it as a wallet
5.	Use it as a hair strain

Intervention:
•	Detach the screen, to make it an audio experience. You can make a beat with it, instead of playing games.  Gameboy for blind people. 
•	You can also change where the buttons are or the screen is. Maybe you were good at a game ones because you are used to the order in which the buttons are on the Gameboy, but now that the order has changed you suddenly became bad at that game.
•	Remove the screen. Use the buttons to hookup the Gameboy to a synthesizer or Midi-Device.


* Hammock Rings *

Performative qualities:
- Steel heavy rings. They can hold a great deal of weight.
- Purpose to hang and adjust your hammock to a tree or pole.

Noticable:
- Two seperate rings are attached to each other and can rotate around
- Not possible to seperate these rings (only with soldering iron). The two rings are closed because of the soldering iron.

Affordances:
- Throw it
- Kick it
- Put it on your wrist as an assesory
- Put it over your knuckels to make the impact of your punches much harder
- You can use it to create a safety belt
